# # Definition

# Variables are containers for storing data.

# # How To Create Variables?

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# # Example:

# In[1]:


x = 5


# In[2]:


name = "Taimoor"


# # Print Function()

# In[3]:


print(x)


# In[4]:


print(name)


# # Case Sensitive

# In[5]:


y = 12


# In[6]:


Y = 10


# # Rules

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

# A variable name cannot start with a number

# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# you cannot give spaces between variable names

# # Example:

# In[7]:


2x = "hello"


# In[9]:


And = 20


# # Multi Words Variable Names

# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# 
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:
# 
# 

# 1) Camel Case

# 2) Pascal Case

# 3) Snake Case

# # Camel Case

# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
# 
# 

# In[10]:


taimoorMirza = 1


# # Pascal Case

# Each word starts with a capital letter:
# 
# 

# In[11]:


TaimoorMirza = 0


# # Snake Case

# Each word is separated by an underscore character:

# In[12]:


taimoor_mirZa = 20


# # Exercise:

# Create a variable age and assign it your age.
# 

# In[13]:


age = 22


# Make a variable with name "color" and assign the name of your favourite color to it.

# In[14]:


color = "red"


# Create Two variables and perform additon process.

# In[15]:


x = 20
y = 30
x+y


# Create Two variables and perform substraction process.

# In[16]:


a = 15
b = 5
a-b


# Create Two variables and perform multiplication process.

# In[17]:


c = 2
h = 5
c*h


# Make two variables, first_name and last_name, to form a full name.

# In[19]:


first_name = "Taimoor"
last_name = "Mirza"
full_name = first_name+last_name
print(full_name)


# Declare two variables, length and width, and calculate the area of a rectangle.

# In[21]:


lenght = 20
width = 30
area = lenght*width
print(area)


# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:
